# CSCI 5593 Cache Simulator

The project is split into two major components:

 * Animation
 * Trace

The animation is a JavaScript/HTML layer that animates output from the trace-driven cache simulator.

The trace-driven cache simulator is a simple simulator that accepts various cache parameters and simulates a cache. The output includes "scripts" that the animation layer can parse and read to generate a visual representation of the simulation.
